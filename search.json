To reduce the size of a hub on your local machine, you can use git sparse checkout. Here’s an example using the FluSight Forecast Hub, but only checking out the model outputs for the FluSight-baseline model:\ngit init FluSight-Forecast-Hub\ncd FluSight-Forecast-Hub\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-Forecast-Hub.git\ngit sparse-checkout set --no-cone '/*' 'model-output/FluSight-baseline*' '!/model-output'\ngit pull origin main\nNow when you run git status, you will see that you only have a fraction of the files on your local machine:\ngit status\n# On branch main\n# You are in a sparse checkout with 14% of tracked files present.\n#\n# nothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n\n\n\n\n hubEnsembles  hubEvals  hubVis\nYou can use the hubEnsembles, hubEvals, and hubVis R packages to do any of the following:\n\ncreate a simple ensemble with hubEnsembles::simple_ensemble()\ncreate a linear pool ensemble with hubEnsembles::linear_pool()\nevaluate model performance with hubEvals::score_model_out()\nvisualize model projections with hubVis::plot_step_ahead_model()\n\n\n\n hubAdmin  hubCI  hubTemplate\n\nCreating a hub\n quickstart  Setting up a hub  Defining model tasks\nTo create a hub, you can start with the hubTemplate.\n\nClick the “Use this template” in the top right corner of the page and choose a name for your hub.\nModify the hub-config/admin.json file with general information about the hub\nModify the hub-config/tasks.json file with information about the model tasks\nUpdate the README.md with general hub data access information\nUpdate the model-outputs/README.md with instructions for modelers\n\n\n\nSetting up a dashboard\n Building a dashboard\nTo set up a dashboard, follow the instructions in the hub dashboard template.\n\n\n\n hubUtils  hubDevs  Developer Guide\nIf you want to help contribute code to the hubverse, it is important to consult the developer guide.\n\nContributing to existing software\nTo contribute to exisiting software packages, be sure to read the contribution guide for the package you want to contribute to. You can find this guide in the CONTRIBUTING.html page of any R package website. Most of these are identical, but there are caveats, For example the hubUtils contributing guide has a section on synchronizing with the schemas and the hubValidations contributing guide has a section on submitting new check functions.\n\n\nCreating new packages\nThe hubDevs package provides tools to help you get started creating a hubverse package.\nNote that nearly all hubverse R packages depend on the hubUtils package in some way.\n\ncreate a new package withhubDevs::create_hubdev_pkg()\nset up a COC and contribution guide withhubDevs::use_hubdev_community()\nset up a documentation site withhubDevs::use_hubdev_pkgdown()\nset up a github repository withhubDevs::use_hubdev_github()"

    "text": "The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs brings together groups working on developing and running modeling hubs in different outbreak prediction settings in collaboration with national and international health agencies, such as the US and European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe initial modeling hubs were developed to provide nowcasts, forecasts, or scenario projections of outbreaks. While the infrastructure we created to support these efforts is readily generalizable to other applications, we note that these motivating examples were for applications that focused on (a) predictive modeling and (b) outbreak settings.\nBuilding off of systems designed for influenza forecasting challenges led by the US CDC, the Reich Lab at UMass-Amherst, in collaboration with the US CDC, developed the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub in early 2020 to support COVID-19 forecasting efforts. This infrastructure was later adapted for use by several other modeling hubs:\nThe hubverse provides tools and a unified framework for aggregating, visualizing, and evaluating forecasts. Although infectious disease forecasting motivated the development of these tools, the approach is meant to be versatile so that the hubverse can be used for other types of forecasts."

    "text": "Scope\nSeveral groups that have worked on supporting and developing the modeling hubs came together in 2022 to initiate a community-driven effort to generalize hub-related tools that were developed “on the go” during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs aims to develop a central open-source suite of tools for creating, hosting, maintaining, and running a modeling hub. While the motivating applications focused on predictive time-series-style modeling of outbreaks, the tools developed as part of this effort are designed to be more general and could be used for other purposes, e.g., for aggregating estimates of parameters of interest.\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to provide a suite of portable and open-source resources that could be relatively easily adapted by new modeling hubs without duplicating efforts."

    "text": "History\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\nThis short paper on collaborative hubs provides a thorough discussion of forecasting hubs for infectious diseases, including the reasoning behind them.\n\n\n\n\nReich, N. G., Lessler, J., Funk, S., Viboud, C., Vespignani, A., Tibshirani, R. J., … & Biggerstaff, M. (2022). Collaborative hubs: making the most of predictive epidemic modeling. American journal of public health, 112(6), 839-842.\nIn the early 2010s, there were many infectious disease forecasting models, but most were published months to years after the forecasted event. These models often had very different targets they were forecasting, such as weekly incidence, epidemic duration, monthly visits, and time of peak incidence. Additionally, the accuracy of these models was evaluated using very different metrics, such as the mean absolute error, median absolute error, and correlation. These factors made comparing forecast models fairly, consistently, and accurately very challenging. In a scoping review of influenza forecasting in human populations published in 2014, Chretien et al. concluded that:\n\nComparing the accuracy of forecasting applications is difficult because forecasting methods, forecast outcomes, and reported validation metrics varied widely.\n— Chretien et al. (2014)\n\n\n\nChretien, J. P., George, D., Shaman, J., Chitale, R. A., & McKenzie, F. E. (2014). Influenza forecasting in human populations: a scoping review. PloS one, 9(4), e94130.\nAt the same time, various efforts were made to aggregate and evaluate forecasts for infectious diseases to better address the challenges they pose from a public health perspective. Below is a timeline of some of the major “hubs” developed since 2013.\n\n\n\nTimeline showing various major infectious disease forecasting hubs. Figure credits: Alex Vespignani and Nicole Samay.\n\n\n\nMotivation\nThere are many reasons to support collaborative modeling rather than relying on a single forecasting model. Firstly, ensemble models are both more accurate and useful than individual models:\n\nA simple average across models has better predictive performance\nEnsemble models are especially reliable for predicting across multiple targets\n\nAdditionally, there are scientific and structural benefits to modeling via hubs:\n\nThey allow comparable evaluation across different models\nThey provide opportunities for scientific exchange and for method & data sharing\nHubs have a greater transparency of model outputs\nHubs can also be a venue for communication with stakeholders\n\nIn working on collaborative forecasting, our principal objectives have been to\n\nConnect forecasting research to decision-making needs\nEvaluate forecast skills and facilitate forecasting research\nOperationalize forecasting\nEnsure increased data availability and real-time forecasting\nForecast and evaluation standardization\nCommunity building (e.g., CSTE, academia, industry)\nAggregate and coordinate the work done by varied forecasting teams\n\n\n\nhubverse retreat\nOur second annual “hubverse retreat” was held June 3–7, 2024 at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This year’s retreat focused on the future of hubs in the cloud, dashboarding, and the archiving of hub data using hubverse standards."

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

    "text": "Modeling Tasks Terminology\n Learn more about modeling tasks\n\nTarget\n\na quantitative outcome of interest for a modeling hub. For example, “incident case counts.” Targets typically (and sometimes implicitly) refer to a value of an observable variable in a given window of time, a given location, and possibly other stratifications (such as age group).\n\nModel output\n\na set of target results in tabular format generated in response to some modeling task for a specific round. A model might result from a single team’s response to the task or from an ensemble of results representing the outcomes of multiple efforts.\n\nRound\n\na time period for which a set of specific model outputs are solicited. Rounds define the “cadence” of submission for a modeling hub. For example, some hubs might accept daily submissions, where each day is considered a different round. Other hubs might have one round every month, with a submission period that may be open for multiple days.\n\nTask\n\na definition of the goals of a modeling effort, possibly including conditions, assumptions, and targets (colectively known as task ID variables). Some tasks may be fixed across rounds, such as for forecast hubs that regularly solicit predictions for a set time horizon in the near-term future. Other tasks may be more variable; for example, those in scenario hubs that model hypothetical futures with different assumptions for different modeling rounds.\n\nTask ID variables\n\na collection of conditions, assumptions, and potentially targets that are used to parameterize a model task. These represent columns in the model output. A more detailed explanation of task ID variables can be found in the documentaiton."

Nowcasts should be set up to be evaluated for accuracy based on comparisons with the eventually observed complete data. See the horizons nomenclature image above.\n\nForecast\n\na specific quantified prediction of an observable event or trend that has yet to be observed, conditional on data that has been observed up to a specified time. Forecasts should be set up to be evaluated for accuracy based on comparisons with the observed data. See the horizons nomenclature image above.\n\nScenario\n\na description of a possible future to be modeled, described in terms of model parameters that might be varied, such as transmissibility, vaccine adoption, vaccine efficacy, the emergence of a new variant, etc.\n\nScenario projection\n\nmodel output that provides estimates of future observations of future trends conditional on specific assumptions about a given scenario. Scenario projects are challenging to evaluate against future observed data since the assumptions under which scenarios were generated likely will never have been exactly met.

The structure of this file is defined by the hubverse model tasks schema.\nThe tasks.json file is responsible for validation of all model submissions and ensures that data are inter-operable.\nA model task defines the expected content of a tabular model submission against one or more modeling targets. It includes three properties:\n\nTask ID variables: a collection of variables and their expected values used for modeling efforts (for example: target (incident hospitalizations), location (Massachusettes), reference_date (2025-04-16), and horizon (-1))\nOutput types: The method modelers should use to summarize the results of their modeling efforts (for example: the quantile probabilities 0.01, 0.025, 0.5, 0.975, 0.99)\nTarget metadata: The caracteristics of the value modelers are trying to predict (for example, incident hospitalizations represent weekly step-ahead continuous count data)"
