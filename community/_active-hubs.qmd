        RVDSS is a national surveillance system that collects and
        reports data on the detection of respiratory viruses,
        including RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), SARS-CoV-2
        (COVID-19), and Influenza. Through laboratory-confirmed
        positive tests, the system helps track the spread of these
        viruses, offering essential data to support public health
        measures, pandemic preparedness, and disease control.
