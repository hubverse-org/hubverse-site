:::{.callout-tip}

We have a [tool suite](software.qmd) that is designed to work with data from any
hub.

:::

The core of the hubverse lies within [the data standards](https://github.com/hubverse-org/schemas#readme) that define
the structure of model submission files.

These standards are encoded in versioned [JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org).

The current version is {{< var version >}}
