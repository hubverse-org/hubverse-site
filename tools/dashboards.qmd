## Introduction

The hubverse dashboard is an expermiental landing page and plug-and-play
visualization for hub data. Each dashboard is an independent repository for any
given hub.

Some examples of dashboards are:


| Hub | Dashboard |
| --- | --------- |
| [flu-metrocast](https://github.com/reichlab/flu-metrocast) | <https://reichlab.io/metrocast-dashboard> |
| [FluSight-forecast-hub](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-Forecast-hub) | <https://reichlab.io/flusight-dashboard> |
| [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://github.com/CDCgov/covid19-forecast-hub) | <https://reichlab.io/covidhub-dashboard> |
| [variant-nowcast-hub](https://github.com/reichlab/variant-nowcast-hub) | <https://reichlab.io/variant-nowcast-hub-dashboard> |

Some example

The current iteration of the dashboard is intended for modelers and hub
administrators, who are more likely to be familiar with modeling exercise and
evaluation methods.

This is not yet intended for use by decision-makers as there is more
information here than they may want or need.
