title: "Consulting Support"

All hubverse tools, packages, and documentation on this website are available open source to anyone looking to use them. However, setting up and maintaining a hub can be complicated and time-consuming, and we therefore recognize the desire that some users may have for additional tailored support. For this reason, we also offer consulting services that can provide additional assistance with tooling and tool development, hub set-up, and ongoing hub maintenance. hubverse software consulting services can be written into grant proposals or directly contracted through the Biostatistics Consulting Center at UMass Amherst. Initial consultations and discussions about the hubverse are free of charge, and we are always happy to discuss whether using the hubverse for your project would be a good fit and help you get launched!
