## Determine what model output you want to collect

You need to answer a few questions first:

1. What quantities do you want to collect? These are your **modeling targets**
2. What variables do you want to use for modeling? These are your **modeling task IDs**
3. What is the modeling horizon (if any)?
4. What kind of estimates do you expect to represent the value of the modeling target (e.g. quantile and mean values)? These are **output types**.
4. How often do you want to take submissions? your **modeling rounds**

By answering these questions, you will be able to determine your **modeling tasks**.
A modeling task focuses on a single target and is made up of a unique
combination of variables used for modeling and the output types. These variables
are collectively known as **task IDs**.
