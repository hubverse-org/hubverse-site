## Determine what you want to forecast

You need to answer a few questions first:

1. What are the quantities you want to forecast? your **modeling targets**
2. What variables do you want to use for modeling? 
3. What is the forecasting horizon (if any)?
4. What kind of estimates do you expect to represent the value of the modeling target (e.g. quantile and mean values)? These are **output types**.
4. How often do you want to take submissions? your **modeling rounds**

By answering these questions, you will be able to determine your **modeling tasks**.
A modeling task focuses on a single target and is made up of a unique
combination of variables used for modeling and the output types. These variables
are collectively known as **task IDs**.
